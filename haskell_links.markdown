% HaskellerZ - Link Collection

This link collection was originally assembled for the [Functional Programming
and Formal Methods](http://www.infsec.ethz.ch/education/ss2012/fmfp) course
taught at the CS department of [ETH Zurich](http://www.ethz.ch).
It is now maintained by the 
[HaskellerZ meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/)
for the benefit of all fellow Haskellers.

Note: if you are interested in Haskell and located near Zurich, then why don't
you drop by in one of the 
[HaskellerZ meetups](http://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/)?
You are very welcome there :-)


## Haskell Beginners

Installing GHCi:

-   The easiest way to install GHCi on OS X and Windows is to use the
    [Haskell platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/) packages.

-   On Linux, we recommend to use GHC packages provided by your
    distribution or the binary packages provided on the [GHC
    hompage](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_7_2_2).

Using GHCi:

-   [Official Website](http://www.haskell.org/ghc), [User's
    Guide](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/ghci.html),
    and
    [Tutorial](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/getting-started.html)

-   Good text editors:
    [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/de/site.htm)
    (Windows), [Kate](http://kate-editor.org/) (Linux with KDE desktop),
    [gedit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/) (Linux with GNOME
    desktop), [jEdit](http://www.jedit.org/) (cross platform),
    [vim](http://www.vim.org/) (cross platform), and
    [emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) (cross platform with
    good [haskell-mode](http://projects.haskell.org/haskellmode-emacs/))

Learning Haskell:

-   The [official Haskell website](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell)

-   A [style guide](https://github.com/tibbe/haskell-style-guide/blob/master/haskell-style.md)
    for writing Haskell code

-   [Hoogle:](http://www.haskell.org/hoogle) search the Haskell
    libraries by name and/or type

-   The [Haskell
    Prelude](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Prelude.html)

-   Free online version of the excellent books [**Real World
    Haskell**](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read) and [**Learn You a
    Haskell for Great Good**](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters).
    Have a look at the [Haskell
    bookshelf](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Books_and_tutorials)
    for more books.

-   Have a look at the
    [Typeclassopedia](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Typeclassopedia)
    to gain more understanding of standard typeclasses like `Functors` and
    `Monads`.

-   Note that the official definition of the syntax and the semantics
    for Haskell is given in the [Haskell 2010
    report](http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/).

## Haskell programmers

### Using the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC)

As soon as you develop some real applications, you'll need a good build
environment and the speed of a compiled executable. The first is given
the the Common Architecture for Building Applications and Libraries
([cabal](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Packaging)). The later is
given by the [Glasgow Haskell Compiler
(GHC)](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/), whose interactive shell GHCi you
are already using. Apart from GHCi, GHC also supports various extensions to
the Haskell language and features an integrated debugger.

-   The [GHCi
    debugger](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/ghci-debugger.html)

-   [Tutorial](http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/blog/2007/11/14) for the
    debugger

-   support for [Concurrent
    Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Concurrency) including
    [Software Transactional
    Memory](http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/stm/index.htm) and a
    prototype of [Data Parallel
    Haskell](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Data_Parallel_Haskell).

### Do not reinvent the wheel: know thy libraries

There exists a fast growing repository of Haskell libraries that will
serve you very well during your daily programming excursions. They are
all developed collaboratively on
[Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/hackage.html) go and check
them out. A few that you should definitively have a look at are:

-   [vector](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector): the state-of-the art array library

-   [bytestring](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring): types and functions to manipulate sequences of bytes

-   [text](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/text): types and functions to manipulate strings, i.e., sequences
    Unicode characters

-   [attoparsec](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/attoparsec): efficiently parsing bytestrings and text values.

-   [aeson](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson): JSON decoding and encoding

-   [cmdargs](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cmdargs): command-line parsing made easy

-   [criterion](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/criterion): benchmarking
    Haskell functions made easy. Note that criterion supports the precise
    measurements of functions taking just a few nano-seconds to execute.

-   [repa](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/repa): high performance,
    regular, multi-dimensional, shape polymorphic parallel arrays. 
    See this [*real-time raytracer*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBd9c1gAqWs)
    implemented using it.

Some of the libraries are also just cool and understanding them will
widen your computer science horizon.

    Data-Structures"](http://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/~ralf/talks/Oxford.pdf)

### Cool Applications: FP in "The Real World"

For a long time, Haskell and other functional languages like
[OCaml](http://caml.inria.fr/),
[SML](http://www.smlnj.org/),
[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/), and
[F#](http://www.fsharp.net/) have been a research only programming languages.
However this is no longer the case. There are companies like
[Galois Inc.](http://www.galois.com/) (Haskell),
[Bluespec](http://www.bluespec.com/) (Haskell),
[Credit Suisse](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2009/09/22/credit-suisse-gmag-seek-trader-tools-project-lead.aspx) (F#)
[Twitter](http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/twitter_on_scala.html) (Scala)
and [quite a few more](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell_in_industry) that are
using functional languages like Haskell to solve their real world
problems. See the book\
["Real World
Haskell"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596514980?ie=UTF8&tag=reaworhas-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596514980)
([online](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read)) for explanations on
how to do this best.

Furthermore, there are also a number of exciting open-source project
being developed using Haskell. Most notably there are:

-   [darcs](http://www.darcs.net/) version control system

-   [xmonad](http://www.xmonad.org/) window manager

-   [yesod](http://www.yesodweb.com/), and
    [snap](http://snapframework.com/), and
    [happstack](http://happstack.com/)
    are Haskell web application servers similar to [Ruby on
    Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/),
    but with added benefits like type safety and the speed of a compiled
    language. See the 
    [book about yesod](http://www.yesodweb.com/book)
    for more information about the benefits.

-   [yi](https://github.com/yi-editor/yi) text editor fully scriptable
    using dynamically loaded Haskell plugins

-   and [many
    more](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Applications_and_libraries)

All of these projects are open for contributions, not to forget that
there surely are plenty of ideas you have that could possibly be
realised using Haskell...

## Haskell Experts

There is a lot of active research going on with respect to functional
languages and more correct and more productive programming in general. A
very good starting point to delve into these topics is [Oleg Kiselyov's
homepage](http://okmij.org/ftp/). For a starting point with respect to
the implementation of functional languages see [Simon Peyton Jones
homepage](http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj). A few topics you
might want to investigate
